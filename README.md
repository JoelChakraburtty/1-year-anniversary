Created from scratch using semantic HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 5 + Bootstrap Icons minified CSS/JS libraries, and AOS (aniamte on scroll) JS external CSS/JS library. Visual assets (such as the image in the hero section) were created in Figma from scratch as well, using a plugin. I also used Google Fonts as an external font provider to optimize visibility of the pages' contents, and designed the colour palette with a Figma plugin. Thank you for viewing my code! :)
